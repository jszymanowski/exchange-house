# Exchange House API

---

#### TODO

- [ ] currency code validation
- [ ] use pydantic for API param validations
- [ ] add transaction to creation
- [ ] use consistent number of decimal places
- [ ] set up email for refresh
- [ ] add support for limit, sort_order in historical API
- [ ] investigate whether `MAX_RECORDS_PER_REQUEST` is working (limit doesn't seem to be imposed client-side)
- [ ] restructure historical response to be less verbose (base/quote currencies)
